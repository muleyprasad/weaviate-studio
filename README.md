## Sample Datasets (Local)

New to Weaviate self-hosting? Spin up local demo datasets with Docker using the included helper script.

- Prerequisites: Docker Desktop with Docker Compose v2
- Script: `./scripts/weaviate-sample-datasets.sh`

Examples
- Start News dataset: `./scripts/weaviate-sample-datasets.sh news`
- Start Wikipedia dataset (CPU): `./scripts/weaviate-sample-datasets.sh wiki`
- Start Wikipedia dataset (GPU): `./scripts/weaviate-sample-datasets.sh wiki-gpu`
- Preload Wikipedia backup (~112GB) and start: `./scripts/weaviate-sample-datasets.sh --wiki-backup wiki`
- Start both: `./scripts/weaviate-sample-datasets.sh all`
- Stop a dataset: `./scripts/weaviate-sample-datasets.sh --down news`
- List available datasets: `./scripts/weaviate-sample-datasets.sh --list`

Notes
- The script caches upstream Docker Compose files under `.weaviate-samples/` (ignored by git).
- For Wikipedia, using `--wiki-backup` downloads and mounts the pre-vectorized dataset so Weaviate starts with data immediately. You can override the backup URL via `--wiki-backup-url <URL>` or `WEAVIATE_WIKI_BACKUP_URL`.
- Upstream demos typically expose Weaviate on `localhost:8080`. If you run multiple datasets simultaneously, adjust the cached compose files to use different host ports.

Port override example
- To run multiple stacks side-by-side, create a compose override that remaps the Weaviate port, then pass it to the script with `--compose-arg "-f <override.yml>"`.

Example override file `weaviate-port-8081.override.yml`:

```
services:
  weaviate:
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"
```

Usage:

```
./scripts/weaviate-sample-datasets.sh --compose-arg "-f weaviate-port-8081.override.yml" wiki
```

## Breaking Changes

- Weaviate client upgrade to `weaviate-client@^3` and move to the Collections API. This requires a Weaviate server that supports the Collections API; legacy class/schemaâ€‘only servers are not supported by this version.
- Webview CSP hardened. Scripts are now nonceâ€‘protected; if you previously saw CSP errors, please upgrade.
- Command rename for refresh: `weaviate.refreshConnections` â†’ `weaviate.refresh` (update custom keybindings if any).

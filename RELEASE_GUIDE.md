## üéØ Marketplace Publishing

### 1. VS Code Marketplace (Primary)

**Prerequisites:**

- Microsoft account with Visual Studio Marketplace publisher access
- Personal Access Token (PAT) from Azure DevOps
- `vsce` CLI tool installed globally

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Create Publisher Account:**

   ```bash
   # Visit https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage
   # Create publisher account for 'prasadmuley'
   ```

2. **Generate Personal Access Token:**

   ```bash
   # Go to https://dev.azure.com/
   # User Settings > Personal Access Tokens
   # Create token with "Marketplace (publish)" scope
   ```

3. **Configure vsce:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vsce
   vsce login prasadmuley
   # Enter your PAT when prompted
   ```

**Publishing Process:**

```bash
# 1. Build the extension
npm run compile
npm run build:webview

# 2. Package the extension
vsce package

# 3. Test the packaged extension
code --install-extension weaviate-studio-<version>.vsix

# 4. Publish to marketplace
vsce publish
```

**Automated Publishing via GitHub Actions:**

1. Set up repository secrets in GitHub:
   - `VSCE_PAT`: Your Visual Studio Marketplace Personal Access Token
2. Create a release on GitHub - this will trigger automated publishing

### 2. Cursor Marketplace

**Current Status:** Cursor uses VS Code extensions via Open VSX Registry

**Publishing Process:**

1. **Create Open VSX Account:**

   ```bash
   # Visit https://open-vsx.org/
   # Sign up with GitHub account
   ```

2. **Install ovsx CLI:**

   ```bash
   npm install -g ovsx
   ```

3. **Get Access Token:**

   ```bash
   # Go to https://open-vsx.org/user-settings/tokens
   # Create new access token
   ```

4. **Publish to Open VSX:**

```bash
ovsx publish weaviate-studio-<version>.vsix -p YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

### 3. Windsurf Marketplace

**Current Status:** Windsurf is relatively new. Research shows they likely support VS Code extensions.

**Publishing Process:**

1. **Check Windsurf Documentation:**

   ```bash
   # Visit Windsurf's official documentation
   # Look for extension marketplace information
   ```

2. **Alternative Approach:**
   - Users can manually install VSIX files
   - Provide direct download links
   - Support manual installation instructions

## üì¶ Release Automation

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Our CI/CD pipeline (`/.github/workflows/ci.yml`) handles:

- **Continuous Integration:** Tests and builds on every push
- **Automated Releases:** Publishes to marketplaces on GitHub releases
- **Artifact Management:** Stores built extensions as GitHub artifacts

### Manual Release Process

1. **Version Bump:**

   ```bash
   # Update package.json version (no tag yet)
   npm version patch|minor|major --no-git-tag-version
   ```

2. **Update Documentation:**

   ```bash
   # Update CHANGELOG.md (Added/Changed/Fixed/Security/Breaking)
   # Update README.md (include Breaking Changes if any)
   ```

3. **Create Release:**

   ```bash
   # Tag must match package.json version with a leading v
   git tag v<version>
   git push origin main --tags

   # Or create release via GitHub web interface
   ```

4. **Monitor Deployment:**
   - Check GitHub Actions for successful deployment
   - Verify extension appears in marketplaces
   - Test installation from marketplace

## üîß Development Tools

### Essential CLI Tools

```bash
# Install development dependencies
npm install -g vsce ovsx

# Verify installation
vsce --version
ovsx --version
```

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Run full test suite
npm test

# Build extension
npm run compile
npm run build:webview

# Package for testing
vsce package

# Test locally
code --install-extension weaviate-studio-<version>.vsix
```

## üìä Post-Release Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

- **Download counts** on each marketplace
- **User ratings and reviews**
- **Issue reports** and bug feedback
- **Feature requests** from users

### Maintenance Tasks

- **Regular updates** based on VS Code API changes
- **Bug fixes** from user reports
- **Feature enhancements** based on feedback
- **Security updates** for dependencies

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Publishing Fails:**

   ```bash
   # Check token permissions
   vsce verify-pat

   # Verify package.json format
   vsce package --no-yarn
   ```

2. **Extension Won't Load:**

   ```bash
   # Check VS Code compatibility
   # Verify all dependencies are bundled
   # Test in clean VS Code environment
   ```

3. **Marketplace Rejection:**
   - Review marketplace guidelines
   - Check for policy violations
   - Ensure all required metadata is present

## ‚ö° Quick Release Checklist (CI/CD Pipeline)

Follow **these six steps** any time you need to publish a new version. The GitHub
Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is wired to run automatically
when a Git tag that starts with `v` is pushed.

1. **Pick the next version number**  
   ‚Äì Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).  
   ‚Äì Patch fix ‚Üí `1.0.0` ‚Üí `1.0.1`  
   ‚Äì Back-compatible feature ‚Üí `1.1.0`  
   ‚Äì Breaking change ‚Üí `2.0.0`.

2. **Update metadata**

   ```bash
   # bump package.json manually or via npm
   npm version <patch|minor|major> --no-git-tag-version
   ```

   ‚Ä¢ Edit `CHANGELOG.md` ‚Äî add a section like:

   ```markdown
   ## [1.0.1] ‚Äî 2025-07-08

   ### Added

   - Something new.

   ### Fixed

   - Something fixed.

   ### Breaking

   - Describe any breaking change and required user action
   ```

3. **Commit and push to `main`**

   ```bash
   git add package.json CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "chore(release): 1.0.1"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Tag _and_ publish the release**

   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Release 1.0.1"
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```

   Then open **GitHub ‚Üí Releases ‚Üí "Draft new release"** and:

   - Select the just‚Äìpushed tag `v1.0.1`.
   - Paste the same CHANGELOG section in the description.
   - Click **Publish release** ‚Äì this fires the `release` event that the
     workflow listens for.

5. **Watch GitHub Actions**  
   The `ci.yml` workflow will:

   - run tests & build (extension + webview)
   - package with `vsce`
   - publish to VS Code Marketplace using the `VSCE_PAT` secret
   - attach the `.vsix` file as a build artifact

6. **Verify**
   - Marketplace listing should show the new version a few minutes after the
     job succeeds.
   - Optionally test the artifact locally:
     ```bash
     code --install-extension weaviate-studio-<version>.vsix --force
     ```

That's it‚Äîno manual `vsce publish` needed. Just remember: **version bump ‚Üí changelog ‚Üí commit ‚Üí tag**.
